run the @tests/integration/fixtures-integration.test.js and review the output. reivew the tests, fixtures, and code and THINK VERY HARD about why there are
differences in the dist and the output files. located the potential issues in the code that may be causing the differences. run a full test suite and compare the
tests and results to the analysis of the integration tests. then write a detailed list of the current issues in the _notes integration-issues.md

then review the @_notes/integration-issues.md and then review the related code. THINK VERY HARD about how to properly solve the identified issues       │
without unneccessary changes. follow best practices and coding standards defined for this project in the @.agent-os/standards/ directory. fo through each            │
identified issue and follow a TDD approach. write a test to reproduce the issue and prove the failure. then implement the fix in the code to correct the issue. run  │
the new test(s) to ensure the fix worked, then run the entire test suite to ensure there are no regressions
