# Product Mission (Lite)

Unify is a Unix-philosophy static site generator that helps frontend developers build maintainable static sites by providing DOM Cascade specification compliance for component-based composition without framework complexity.

Unify serves frontend developers and teams who need component-based static sites without framework overhead. Unlike proprietary templating systems, Unify implements the open DOM Cascade specification for portable component architecture and delivers 3-5x faster build times through Bun-native performance optimization.
